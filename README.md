# Reflection 1

The handle_connection function is responsible for processing incoming TCP connections from a web client. It takes a mutable TcpStream as input, wraps it in a buffered reader to enable efficient line-by-line reading, and reduces system calls. The function reads the HTTP request by iterating through each line of the input stream, mapping the results to handle errors, and stopping at the first empty line, which marks the end of the request headers. Finally, it collects the request lines into a vector and prints them in a formatted output to the console for debugging.
